# Create-Own-Language
Have Tried Creating Own Language , implemented JavaScript , Own Newly Made  Code gets Converted into the JavaScript  just Like C program converts into Assembly After Compiling it , You can also convert Own Made Language just by changing the Format inside the Function Named codeGen() , Cheers !
