# Create-Own-Language

Have you ever tried creating your own language? It's like implementing JavaScript, where your newly made code gets converted into JavaScript, similar to how a C program converts into assembly after compiling it. You can also convert your own made language by simply changing the format inside the function named `codeGen()`.

Make sure to do 'npm install node' in your terminal in the folder where you are going to save the program. This ensures successful execution of this JavaScript code in VS Code. Without this, the output won't be visible in the terminal.

Cheers!
